        <h3>About the Journal</h3>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>LANDING is an international platform that facilitates critical and  creative artistic inquiry, with a special focus on research methods and  an ethos of research. LANDING was established in 2024 by Miklós (Miki) Ambrózy, Sophie Durand, and Povilas Marozas, with the tireless support of Ieva Butkutė and Adomas Žudys.</p>
        <h4>Scopes</h4>
        <p>LANDING is focused on how  practice-based research is done on the ground, in the studio, in the   world, with and through materials and other forms of life. Rather than  existing in the space of theory and speculation, LANDING  is focused on  the doing of research and its explicit or tacit methods. It wants to  operate as a space of conversation and resource for fellow practitioners. LANDING wants to imbue encouragement and  excitement about the trajectory of research done by artists, designers,  architects; one’s own as well as the research of others. <br><br> While English is the working language of the journal, we acknowledge  that it is not the only language in the field and definitely not the master language of artistic research.  LANDING  is designed to be multilingual - we accept submissions in all  languages and will endeavor to support  researchers with translations into English and Lithuanian.</p>
        <h4>Values</h4>
        <p>The journal is currently operated by a team of volunteers and two artistic research staff. The values that the editorial team aspires to are listed below: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turning towards, with an emphasis on care and generosity</li>
            <li>Accountability as care for relations on all levels: ourselves, peers, Doctoral Department of the host institution, forms of life involved.</li>
            <li>Collectivity. We value trust in our interactions, and we rely on actively developing roles.</li>
            <li>We are open to critical feedback in line with the values above in order to offer a quality process and product for artistic researchers in Lithuania and elsewhere</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The infrastructure of the journal aims  to support the needs of the  doctoral candidates and post-doctoral  researchers, locally and internationally. The journal remains flexible  and  adaptable to the changing community and their unique needs. This  creates a delicate balance between  support for the community of  candidates locally and ensuring that there are ethical processes of peer review in place. Currently candidates from VDA move directly to the  Peer Review rounds. Moderation  prior to that is done through members of the editorial board for each given issue. All peer reviewers  are  handled externally. The final decision to proceed with publishing is at  the discretion of the external  reviewers. This may undergo refinements  as the identity and form of LANDING develops.  </p>
