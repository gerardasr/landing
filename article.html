                            <p class="abstract">A glacier is shaped through the accumulation of ice, snow, rock, and  sediment. As a being of its own, the glacier triggers our imagination.  It’s the difference between inhuman forces and our human fragility that  creates the desire to observe, engage, relate, and touch. Landing has  evolved through encounters of practices and propositions. We convene  around twenty-one submissions presented here. Our collaboration is  shaped by close reading and reflections between the editorial team, our  advisory board, the authors of Edge of the Glacier’s text/image  submissions, and our community of peer reviewers.</p>
