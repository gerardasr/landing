                <h3>Call for Issue 2 of Landing Lingering & <br>Documentation as Real-Time Archiving</h3>
                <p>"I suppose an archive gives you a kind of valley in which your  thoughts can bounce back to you, transformed. You whisper intuitions and thoughts into the emptiness, hoping to hear something back. And  sometimes, just sometimes, an echo does indeed return, a real  reverberation of something, bouncing back with clarity when you've  finally hit the right pitch and found the right surface." (Luiselli 2019 p. 42) The two themes are expanded below. They are stones to step onto and  step off from, intentionally left open for transdisciplinary approaches. We are interested in unique instances where one set of conventions  (background in arts, architecture, design, the sciences, or specific  practices) is affected by another–a different set or system of methods,  tools, approaches and conventions–as well as how experience in a field  is displaced by new life experience or by another specialisation.</p>
                <h3>Expanded Call</h3>
                <p>The second issue of Landing invites propositions to convene around lingering and documentation as forms of archiving.</p>
                <h3>Lingering</h3>
                <p>I went to a concert at Liepkalnis Water Storage (Vilnius,  Lithuania, Europe), which was marketed with the promise that the venue  creates a twenty second reverb. The possibility of experiencing an  extended echo lured me in (the fish) and the invitation (the bait) was  accepted.</p>
                <p>Going with my friend, I was thinking that the Liepkalnis Water  Storage might not actually be a space that creates such a reverb;  someone may have been hooked onto this fact in passing, transforming it  into a desired truth, which in turn transformed my misunderstanding into truth.</p>
                <p>I entered the underground dome with certain expectations, wanting to know more about Pauline Oliveros’s score. The stage was lit with a  cold RGB blue, and the text scores were ongoing. I didn’t get to hear a single reverb.</p>
